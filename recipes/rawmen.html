      <h2>The Art of Japanese Ramen</h2>
      <p>
        Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle dish known for its rich broth, chewy
        wheat noodles, and flavorful toppings. Its origins trace back to China,
        but it has become a staple of Japanese cuisine with many regional
        variations. Common broth types include soy sauce (shoyu), miso, salt
        (shio), and pork bone (tonkotsu), each offering a unique taste
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typical toppings include sliced pork (chashu), marinated soft-boiled
        eggs, bamboo shoots, green onions, and seaweed. Whether enjoyed in a
        small ramen shop or made at home, ramen combines comfort and depth of
        flavor in every bowl.
