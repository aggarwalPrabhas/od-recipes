    <h2>The Art of Japanese Ramen</h2>
    <p>
      Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle dish known for its rich broth, chewy
      wheat noodles, and flavorful toppings. Its origins trace back to China,
      but it has become a staple of Japanese cuisine with many regional
      variations. Common broth types include soy sauce (shoyu), miso, salt
      (shio), and pork bone (tonkotsu), each offering a unique taste experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typical toppings include sliced pork (chashu), marinated soft-boiled eggs,
      bamboo shoots, green onions, and seaweed. Whether enjoyed in a small ramen
      shop or made at home, ramen combines comfort and depth of flavor in every
      bowl.
