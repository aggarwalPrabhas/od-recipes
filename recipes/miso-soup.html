      <h2>Comfort in a Bowl: Miso Soup</h2>
      <p>
        Miso soup is a traditional Japanese dish made with a savory broth called
        dashi and miso paste, a fermented soybean seasoning. It’s a staple in
        Japanese cuisine, often served as a side dish with rice or meals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The soup typically includes soft tofu cubes, seaweed (wakame), and green
        onions. Light yet flavorful, miso soup is not only comforting but also
        rich in probiotics and nutrients, making it both delicious and
        nourishing.

      <h3>Steps to Make Miso Soup</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the Dashi</strong> Heat water and add kombu (dried
          kelp). Just before boiling, remove the kombu and add bonito flakes.
          Simmer briefly, then strain the liquid to get clear dashi.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Ingredients</strong> Return the dashi to the pot. Add
          wakame and cubed tofu, and let it simmer for a few minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mix in Miso Paste</strong> Turn off the heat. Dissolve miso
          paste in a ladle with a bit of hot broth, then stir it back into the
          soup. Avoid boiling after adding miso to preserve flavor and
          nutrients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Garnish and Serve</strong> Add chopped green onions. Serve hot
          and enjoy!
